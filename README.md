Weather Tracker

For this assignment, We were tasked with creating dashboard that tracks the weather information for whatever city the user chooses from scratch.

### Prerequisites

In order to use the weather dashboard, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look. 
Main features include:
- A search function that allows you to input a city and see the weather data on that city for today as well as the next 5 days
- A color coded uv index to tell you weather or not it's safe to go outside without sunscreen
- The last 5 searched cities will be saved to local storage so if you want to you can go back and access those at any point

Upon initially loading in to the site you will see this:

After searching for the city you'd like to see weather information on you will be presented with 6 widgets displaying the weather data for that city for today, as well as the next 5 days:

After you search for a city, along with the weather information for that city, you'll also see a list start to populate with all the cities you've searched previously. If you click on one of the buttons in the list, you will be presented with the weather information for the city listed on that button
